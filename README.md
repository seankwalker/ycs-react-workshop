# YCS React Workshop

This is the code for the YCS React Workshop from March 29, 2018. You'll find the source code in `src/`, but the main interesting parts is `index.js`. Additionally, I have code from the "phases" of the app being built in `src/stages/`.

Hope this is helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email! :) <3 Sean and YCS
